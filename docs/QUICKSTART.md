This creates a `dist/` folder with your compiled extension.

5. Done! ðŸŽ‰ The extension appears in your toolbar

## Verify It Works

2. The popup should open
3. Paste some medical text
4. Click **"Simplify"** or **"Summarize"**
5. Check the browser console (F12) for any errors

## Development

For development with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then rebuild and reload the extension in Chrome after making changes.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run dev          # Development with hot reload
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript errors
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
```
